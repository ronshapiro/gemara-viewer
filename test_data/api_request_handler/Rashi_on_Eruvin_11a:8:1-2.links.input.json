      "<b>there are</b> people available <b>to bury it. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is</b> the corpse that is considered <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>?Any</b> corpse <b>that has no one</b> available <b>to bury it.</b> If, however, the deceased has friends or relatives to tend to his burial, his corpse is not considered a <i>met mitzva</i>. Likewise, if the body is in a place where if <b>one calls out, others</b> can <b>answer him, this is not a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b> The <i>Tosefta</i> teaches a novel ruling applicable to the case of a military camp: A solider is buried where he was killed, even if the conditions for <i>met mitzva</i> are not met there.",
      "With regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself, the Gemara asks: <b>And does a <i>met mitzva</i></b> actually <b>acquire its place? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who finds a corpse laid out on a main street evacuates it</b> for burial either <b>to the right of the street or to the left of the street,</b> but it may not be buried under the main street itself?",
      "If one can move the corpse either to <b>an uncultivated field or</b> to <b>a plowed field, he evacuates it to the uncultivated field.</b> If the choice is between <b>a plowed field and a sown field, he evacuates it to the plowed field.</b> If <b>both</b> fields <b>are plowed,</b> or if <b>both are sown,</b> or if <b>both are uncultivated, he evacuates it to any side that he wishes</b> to move it. Apparently, a <i>met mitzva</i> is not necessarily buried where it is found. It may be moved elsewhere.",
      "<b>Rav Beivai said: Here we are dealing with a corpse laid out across on the side</b> of a public path, and it stretches across the path and reaches the other side. Were the corpse buried there, it would prohibit passage by priests. <b>Since permission was</b> already <b>granted to evacuate it from the side</b> of a public path, <b>one may evacuate it to any side he wishes.</b> If, however, the corpse was in a field, moving it would be prohibited.",
      "We learned in the mishna that in a military camp <b>one is exempt from</b> ritual <b>washing</b> of the <b>hands. Abaye said: They taught</b> this exemption <b>only</b> with regard to <b>first waters,</b> i.e., hand-washing before eating. <b>However, final waters,</b> i.e., hand-washing after eating and before reciting Grace after Meals, <b>is an obligation</b> even in a military camp.",
      "<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say that the final waters are an obligation?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there is the presence of Sodomite salt, which blinds the eyes</b> even in a small amount. Since Sodomite salt could remain on one’s hands, one must wash them after eating. This obligation is binding even in a camp because soldiers are also obligated to maintain their health.",
      "<b>Abaye said: And</b> this type of dangerous salt <b>is present</b> in the proportion of a single <b>grain [<i>korta</i>] in an</b> entire <b><i>kor</i></b> of innocuous salt. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If <b>one measured salt</b> and came into contact with Sodomite salt not during mealtime, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is there an obligation to wash his hands afterward? <b>He said to him: It was unnecessary</b> to say <b>this,</b> as he is certainly obligated to do so.",
      "The mishna continues: <b>And</b> in a military camp, one is exempt <b>from</b> the separation of tithes from <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>]. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may feed the poor <i>demai</i>, and</b> one may also feed <b>quartered soldiers [<i>akhsanya</i>] <i>demai</i>. Rav Huna said:</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>one may neither feed the poor <i>demai</i>, nor</b> may one feed <b>quartered soldiers <i>demai</i>. And Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>one may feed the poor <i>demai</i>, and</b> one may also feed <b>quartered soldiers <i>demai</i>.</b>",
      "We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> in a military camp, one is exempt <b>from establishing an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: They taught</b> that this exemption applies <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the joining of</b> houses in <b>courtyards. However,</b> even those in a military encampment <b>are obligated</b> to establish an <i>eiruv</i> if they desire to effect <b>a joining of Shabbat boundaries,</b> whereby one extends the Shabbat limits beyond which one may not walk on Shabbat.",
      "<b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One is flogged by Torah law for</b> going beyond the Shabbat limit if there is no <b>joining of Shabbat boundaries.</b> The Torah states: “No man shall go out [<i>al yetze</i>] of his place on the seventh day” (Exodus 16:29). Since this is a Torah prohibition, leniency is possible only in life-threatening circumstances.",
      "<b>Rabbi Yonatan strongly objects: Is one flogged for</b> violating <b>a prohibition that is</b> expressed in the Torah with the negative <b><i>al</i>,</b> rather than the negative <i>lo</i>? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects</b> to the question: <b>If</b> what you say is <b>so,</b> with regard to <b>that which is written: “Turn you not [<i>al</i>] unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits”</b> (Leviticus 19:31), is the <i>halakha</i> there <b>too that one is not flogged?</b>",
      "Rather, <b>this is</b> the <b>difficulty for Rabbi Yonatan:</b> The prohibition against overstepping the Shabbat limits is <b>a prohibition that was given</b> primarily <b>as a warning of court-imposed capital punishment,</b> i.e., a prohibition which, under certain conditions, is punishable by the death and not merely by lashes, as is the case with most prohibitions. In fact, the prohibition against carrying objects out to the public domain is derived from that same verse, and one who violates that prohibition is liable for execution by the court. <b>And</b> this principle applies: <b>Any prohibition that was given</b> primarily <b>as a warning of court-imposed capital punishment one is not flogged,</b> even if the death penalty does not apply in that particular case.",
      "<b>Rav Ashi said: Is it written</b> in the Torah: <b>No</b> man <b>shall carry out [<i>yotzi</i>],</b> indicating a prohibition against carrying objects from one domain to another on Shabbat? <b>“No</b> man <b>shall go out [<i>yetze</i>]” is written.</b> Indeed, according to its plain meaning, the verse deals exclusively with the prohibition of going beyond the Shabbat limits and not with the prohibition of carrying out. Everyone agrees that there is no death penalty administered by the court in overstepping the Shabbat limit.",
      "",
      "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may arrange</b> upright <b>boards [<i>passin</i>] around a well</b> in the public domain in order to permit drawing water from the well on Shabbat. A well is usually at least four handbreadths wide and ten handbreadths deep. Therefore, it is considered a private domain, and it is prohibited to draw water from it on Shabbat, as that would constitute a violation of the prohibition to carry from a private domain into a public one. The Sages therefore instituted that a virtual partition may be built in the area surrounding the well, so that the enclosed area could be considered a private domain, thus permitting use of the well and carrying of the water within the partitioned area.",
      "In this specific instance, the Sages demonstrated special leniency and did not require a proper partition to enclose the entire area. For this purpose, it suffices if there are <b>four double posts [<i>deyomadin</i>] that look like eight</b> single posts, i.e., four corner pieces, each comprised of two posts joined together at right angles; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> There must be <b>eight</b> posts that <b>look like twelve.</b> How so? There must be <b>four double posts,</b> one in each corner, with <b>four plain</b> posts, one between each pair of double posts.",
      "<b>The height</b> of the double posts must be at least <b>ten handbreadths, their width</b> must be <b>six</b> handbreadths, <b>and their thickness</b> may be even <b>a minimal amount. And between them,</b> i.e., between the posts, there may be a gap <b>the size of two teams [<i>revakot</i>] of three oxen each;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
      "<b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> There may be a slightly larger gap, the size of two teams <b>of four</b> oxen each, and this gap is measured with the cows being <b>tied</b> together <b>and not untied,</b> and with the minimal space necessary for <b>one</b> team to be <b>entering</b> while the other <b>one is leaving.</b>",
      "<b>It is permitted to bring</b> the posts <b>closer to the well, provided that</b> the enclosed area is large enough for <b>a cow to</b> stand with <b>its head and the majority of its</b> body <b>inside</b> the partitioned space while <b>it drinks.</b>",
      "<b>It is permitted</b>"
