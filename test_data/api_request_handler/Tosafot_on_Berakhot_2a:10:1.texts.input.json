  "text": "<b><small>IF SO, THE END [OF THE MISHNA] THAT TEACHES [US OF THE BLESSING OF SHEMA] IN THE MORNING FIRST ETC.</small></b> The Gemara suggested two reasons that the Mishna spoke of the obligation to recite the evening Shema first:<br>A) The verse about the reciting Shema states: <b> ובשכבך ובקומך </b>- when you lie down and when you arise, putting the evening obligation first.<br>B) The Mishna follows the order of creation‘<b>ויהי ערב ויהי בוקר</b>-there was evening and there was morning’, which speaks of night before day.<br>When the Gemara introduces a question with <b>אי הכי</b>-if so, it indicates that the difficulty is addressed only to the second answer just mentioned, but not to the first answer. The ‘if so’ is saying that according to the first approach A) there is no problem, but according to the second approach just introduced B), there is a problem. Tosfos explains how this works in our Gemara: <b>It is perfectly understandable if you say that </b>the order of the Mishna is <b>based on the verse of “בשכבך-when you lie down”, if that is so, the verse is only particular about reciting Shema </b>but not about the blessings preceding and following recital of Shema.<br>But if you say that the order of the Mishna is <b>based on the verse of creation of the world, then </b>one should be <b>particular </b>to follow this order for <b>all matters </b>including the blessings of Shema.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See מהרש\"א who raises a very fundamental question: How can Tosfos say that if we follow the verse on creation, we must always follow the order of night before day, when the verse discussing the tamid offering clearly places the morning tamid before the evening tamid? מהרש\"א suggests that Tosfos holds that as far as the verse per se is concerned it may sometimes choose to follow one order and at other times follow a different order. The point that Tosfos is making is that if the Tanna chose to follow the order of creation, where night precedes day, the Tanna must be consistent and follow that order in all matters. Proof of this explanation is from the previous Tosfos, where Tosfos says that the Gemara’s question: The Tanna should first teach us about the recital of Shema in the morning is based on the verse that puts the morning tamid first. The Gemara answers: The Tanna is following the order of the verse that deals with reciting Shema, where the evening Shema is mentioned first. The Gemara does not seem to have a problem with the fact that there appears to be a contradiction between the two verses. Obviously, the verse sometimes follows one order and at other times a different order. The Gemara is concerned with discovering the order that the Tanna elected to follow.</i><br>The Gemara therefore concludes its question: <b>If so, </b>that the Mishna is following the order of creation, <b>the end </b>of the Mishna <b>that teaches etc. </b>[about the blessing of Shema should also begin with the blessings of the morning.]",
